# Smart Beehive

## Weight

Monitoring hive weight gives beekeepers an indication of the start and stop of
nectar flow, alerting them to the need to feed (when weight is low) and to
harvest honey (when weight is high). Comparing weight across hives gives
beekeepers a sense of the relative productivity of each colony. A dramatic drop
in weight can suggest that the colony has swarmed, or the hive has been knocked
over by animals. And

## Temperature 

Monitoring hive temperature can alert beekeepers to dangerous conditions:
excessive heat indicating the hive should be moved to a shady spot or
ventilated; unusually low heat indicating the hive should be insulated or
protected from cold winds.

## Humidity 

While honey production produces a humid environment in hives, excessive
humidity, especially in the winter, can be a danger to colonies.  Monitoring
humidity levels can let beekeepers know that moisture build-up is occurring,
indicating a need for better ventilation and water removal.

## Acoustics

Acoustic monitoring within hives can alert beekeepers to a number of dangerous
situations: specific changes in sound patterns can indicate the loss of a
queen, swarming tendency, disease, or hive raiding.

## Bee count

Counting the number of bees entering and leaving a hive can give beekeepers an
indication of the size and health of colonies. For commercial beekeepers this
can indicate nectar flow, and the need to relocate hives to more productive
areas.
