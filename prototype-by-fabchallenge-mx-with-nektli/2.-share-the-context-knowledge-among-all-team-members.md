# 2. Share the context knowledge among all team members

Both teams gathered briefly to share initial context, current approach that the host team (Cauce) was working on, and challenges they were facing. Then, the guest team (FabChallenge) had a couple of hours to brainstorm ideas.

Later on that day, an in-person conversation was carried out with high-context people from diverse backgrounds and sectors. All of them had already participated in activities within the FabLab and community center. Examples of these participants are:

* a professor that had already brought her students,
* a student that came to several activities,
* a businesswoman representing the SME sector,
* members of NGOs,
* employees and voluntaries from the Cauce Foundation.

In this gathering people shared their understanding about the problem and the obstacles they found in solving them. To close the gathering, the guest team presented their first solution idea to receive feedback from the audience.

The audience replied with both positive comments and concerns. The guest team did not counter-argument, instead they took notes. The team was not there to defend the proposal but to present it as an exploratory exercise to identify the path forward.

One key thing that the guest team did was to reply one big concern with the question: What would you need to adopt this solution?
