The data is compressed on the microcontroller into data packets that are as compact as possible and then sent by the microcontroller via LoRaWan and received by one or more gateways. These gateways send the data on to a server (in our case, thethingsnetwork). On thethingsnetwork's side, the data packets are brought back to the correct units. A webhook to our website has also been set up.
